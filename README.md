# Input-Output
Semester project for CSCI 2467 
Motivation:
  My motivation for creating this project was to make an extensible and reusable package
  for performing basic arithematic operations on Matricies, Vectors, and Rational Numbers 
  protected against Overflow and bad user operation requests.
